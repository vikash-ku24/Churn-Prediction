# Churn-Prediction
A project used to predict the number of customers going to stop the services with a telecom company.

The churn rate, also known as the rate of attrition or customer churn, is the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity. It is most commonly expressed as the percentage of service subscribers who discontinue their subscriptions within a given time period.
